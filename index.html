            Her eyes are wide open. Her lips
            parted as if to speak. Her dead body
            frozen in the ice. She is not the only
            one. When a young boy discovers the
            body of a woman beneath a thick sheet
            of ice in a South London park,
            Detective Erika Foster is called in to
            lead the murder investigation. The
            victim, a beautiful young socialite,
            appeared to have the perfect life. Yet
            when Erika begins to dig deeper, she
            starts to connect the dots between the
            murder and the killings of three
            prostitutes, all found strangled,
            hands bound and dumped in water around
            London. What dark secrets is the girl
            in the ice hiding? As Erika inches
            closer to uncovering the truth, the
            killer is closing in on Erika. The
            last investigation Erika led went
            badly wrong... resulting in the death
            of her husband. With her career
            hanging by a thread, Erika must now
            battle her own personal demons as well
            as a killer more deadly than any she's
            faced before. But will she get to him
            before he strikes again?
